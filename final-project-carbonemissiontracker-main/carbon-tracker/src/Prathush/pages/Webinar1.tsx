                <p>
                    With increased visibility and more climate action, green claims have received bad press, challenged ads and fines. At the same time, the regulatory landscape is signalling the end of misleading and unsubstantiated claims with legislative changes. Instead, it seeks to drive an increase in credible claims, based on clear fact, evidence and with appropriate communication.

                <p>
                    This increased scrutiny causes businesses to reflect: how can we accurately communicate our productâ€™s environmental performance and provide consumer transparency?

                    During this session, our experts discussed the rapidly changing space of climate claims. Since launching the world's first product carbon footprint label in 2007, expectations on businesses to take climate action and to be transparent about it have grown significantly. We outlined what upcoming regulatory changes will mean for businesses and how you can elevate your communications to avoid the pitfalls of greenwashing. In this webinar we discussed:
